python demos/demo_custom_voice.py

# Run the voice cloning demo
python demos/demo_voice_clone.py

# Run the web interface
python demos/web_demo.py
```

### Web Interface

```bash
# Launch the interactive web UI
python demos/web_demo.py
# Open browser to http://localhost:7860

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Custom Voice Generation

```python
import torch
from qwen_tts import Qwen3TTSModel

# Load the model
model = Qwen3TTSModel.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-CustomVoice",
    device_map="cuda:0",
    dtype=torch.bfloat16
)

# Generate speech
wavs, sr = model.generate_custom_voice(
    text="Hello! This is my AI text-to-speech system.",
    language="English",
    speaker="Ryan",
    instruct="Speak with enthusiasm and energy"
)
```

### Example 2: Voice Cloning

```python
# Clone a voice from a 3-second sample
wavs, sr = model.generate_voice_clone(
    text="I can clone any voice with just 3 seconds of audio!",
    language="English",
    ref_audio="path/to/reference.wav",
    ref_text="Reference audio transcript"
)
```
